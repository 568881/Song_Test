I just need to get it off my chest
Yeah, more than you know Yeah, more than you know
You should know that baby you're the best
Yeah, more than you know Yeah, more than you know

I saw it coming, from miles away
I better speak up if I got something to say
'Cause it ain't over, until she sings
You had your reasons, you had a few
But you knew that I would go anywhere for you
'Cause it ain't over, until she sings
